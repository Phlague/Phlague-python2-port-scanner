# Phlague-python2-port-scanner
This is a Python2 port scanner i created, it mostly scans ip address for common ports, but, if there are any other particular ports opened, it will scan them as well. Usage: python2 phlague-port-scanner.py 1.1.1.1  \ You can scan any ip address of your choice, though. I hope you enjoy.
